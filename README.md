# Course Project 2 - Getting and Cleaning Data - Coursera

The aim of this course is to make an analysis of a set of variables collected from the accelerometers of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone for a group of 30 individuals (Subject variable).

The data set which is used in this program can be downloaded in this link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To run this analysis, the file run_analysis.R should be located in the folder extracted from the downloaded zipped dataset. By running run_analysis.R, a tidy_data.txt is generated with the mean and standard deviation values for the different individuals and activities.

More information about the variables and the run_analysis.R script can be found in the CodeBook.md in this repository.
